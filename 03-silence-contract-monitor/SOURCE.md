# 03 — Silence & Contract Monitor

## Overview

Monitors accounts for engagement gaps that may signal churn risk. Every morning at 6:30 AM, the workflow pulls accounts and checks for those that have "gone silent" — no meaningful engagement activity within a configured lookback window. For flagged accounts, it uses the LLM to assess the severity of the silence, considering deal stage, contract dates, and historical patterns. Accounts deemed concerning are surfaced via Alert (Slack, Teams, or Email) so the owning rep or CSM can re-engage.

The production template uses canonical source, identity, delivery-rendering, and run-summary contracts. The model is limited to structured evidence analysis; source access, claims, routing, delivery, and observability are deterministic.

## Contracts

- `run_context`: mode, dry-run, source, lookback, and delivery defaults
- `source_record`: one canonical record with a stable source ID
- `enrichment_context`: Backstory MCP evidence used only during analysis
- `delivery_payload`: deterministic target, body, thread key, and dedupe key

## Production Configuration

- `SCM_SOURCE_API_BASE_URL`
- `SCM_SOURCE_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `SCM_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID`
- `SCM_SUMMARY_CHANNEL_ID`
- `SCM_LOOKBACK_DAYS`
- `SCM_MAX_RECORDS`
- `SCM_DRY_RUN`
- Shared source, identity, delivery renderer, and run-summary workflow IDs

## Safety

1. The source adapter owns stable IDs and processed-record claims.
2. The model returns JSON and cannot deliver or mutate systems.
3. Delivery requires dry-run off, notification eligibility, and a resolved target.
4. The starter uses a fictional fixture and cannot contact source or delivery systems by default.
