# Silence & Contract Monitor — Platform-Agnostic Recipe

## Reference Architecture

`trigger -> canonical source adapter -> Backstory enrichment -> structured analysis -> identity resolution -> delivery renderer -> native delivery -> run summary`

## Implementation Rules

1. Normalize connector-specific data into one canonical source record.
2. Use Backstory MCP only for enrichment and evidence analysis.
3. Require structured model output before deterministic routing.
4. Use stable source IDs, claims, and dedupe keys.
5. Keep dry-run enabled until representative source, routing, and delivery tests pass.

## Purpose

Monitors accounts for engagement gaps that may signal churn risk. Every morning at 6:30 AM, the workflow pulls accounts and checks for those that have "gone silent" — no meaningful engagement activity within a configured lookback window. For flagged accounts, it uses the LLM to assess the severity of the silence, considering deal stage, contract dates, and historical patterns. Accounts deemed concerning are surfaced via Alert (Slack, Teams, or Email) so the owning rep or CSM can re-engage.
