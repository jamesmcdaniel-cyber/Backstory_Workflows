# 07 — Churn Risk Scorecard

## Overview

Generates a weekly churn risk scorecard for the customer success team. The workflow pulls engagement trends, support ticket volumes, champion contact activity, and product usage signals from Backstory and the CRM. An AI agent scores each account on a 1-10 churn risk scale, identifies the top risk drivers, and suggests specific save plays. The scorecard is delivered to CS managers via Messaging with accounts ranked by risk severity.

The production template uses canonical source, identity, delivery-rendering, and run-summary contracts. The model is limited to structured evidence analysis; source access, claims, routing, delivery, and observability are deterministic.

## Contracts

- `run_context`: mode, dry-run, source, lookback, and delivery defaults
- `source_record`: one canonical record with a stable source ID
- `enrichment_context`: Backstory MCP evidence used only during analysis
- `delivery_payload`: deterministic target, body, thread key, and dedupe key

## Production Configuration

- `CRS_SOURCE_API_BASE_URL`
- `CRS_SOURCE_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `CRS_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID`
- `CRS_SUMMARY_CHANNEL_ID`
- `CRS_LOOKBACK_DAYS`
- `CRS_MAX_RECORDS`
- `CRS_DRY_RUN`
- Shared source, identity, delivery renderer, and run-summary workflow IDs

## Safety

1. The source adapter owns stable IDs and processed-record claims.
2. The model returns JSON and cannot deliver or mutate systems.
3. Delivery requires dry-run off, notification eligibility, and a resolved target.
4. The starter uses a fictional fixture and cannot contact source or delivery systems by default.
