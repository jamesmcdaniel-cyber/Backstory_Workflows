# Churn Risk Scorecard — Platform-Agnostic Recipe

## Reference Architecture

`trigger -> canonical source adapter -> Backstory enrichment -> structured analysis -> identity resolution -> delivery renderer -> native delivery -> run summary`

## Implementation Rules

1. Normalize connector-specific data into one canonical source record.
2. Use Backstory MCP only for enrichment and evidence analysis.
3. Require structured model output before deterministic routing.
4. Use stable source IDs, claims, and dedupe keys.
5. Keep dry-run enabled until representative source, routing, and delivery tests pass.

## Purpose

Generates a weekly churn risk scorecard for the customer success team. The workflow pulls engagement trends, support ticket volumes, champion contact activity, and product usage signals from Backstory and the CRM. An AI agent scores each account on a 1-10 churn risk scale, identifies the top risk drivers, and suggests specific save plays. The scorecard is delivered to CS managers via Messaging with accounts ranked by risk severity.
