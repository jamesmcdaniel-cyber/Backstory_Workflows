# Renewal Prep Brief — Platform-Agnostic Recipe

## Reference Architecture

`trigger -> canonical source adapter -> Backstory enrichment -> structured analysis -> identity resolution -> delivery renderer -> native delivery -> run summary`

## Implementation Rules

1. Normalize connector-specific data into one canonical source record.
2. Use Backstory MCP only for enrichment and evidence analysis.
3. Require structured model output before deterministic routing.
4. Use stable source IDs, claims, and dedupe keys.
5. Keep dry-run enabled until representative source, routing, and delivery tests pass.

## Purpose

Automatically generates renewal preparation briefs at 60, 30, and 15 days before each account's renewal date. The workflow queries the CRM for upcoming renewals, enriches each account with Backstory engagement trends, support history, expansion signals, and key contact activity. An AI agent produces a structured brief covering account health, risk factors, expansion opportunities, and a recommended renewal strategy. Briefs are delivered to the assigned CSM and account executive via Messaging.
