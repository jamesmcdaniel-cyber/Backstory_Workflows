# 09 — Onboarding Pulse

## Overview

Monitors newly closed deals during their first 90 days to detect accounts going dark before they become a retention problem. The workflow identifies recently closed-won accounts, checks Backstory engagement data for post-sale activity (meetings booked, emails exchanged, contacts engaged), and flags accounts with below-threshold engagement. An AI agent assesses each flagged account and recommends specific re-engagement actions. Alerts are sent to the CSM and sales handoff team via Messaging.

The production template uses canonical source, identity, delivery-rendering, and run-summary contracts. The model is limited to structured evidence analysis; source access, claims, routing, delivery, and observability are deterministic.

## Contracts

- `run_context`: mode, dry-run, source, lookback, and delivery defaults
- `source_record`: one canonical record with a stable source ID
- `enrichment_context`: Backstory MCP evidence used only during analysis
- `delivery_payload`: deterministic target, body, thread key, and dedupe key

## Production Configuration

- `OP_SOURCE_API_BASE_URL`
- `OP_SOURCE_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `OP_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID`
- `OP_SUMMARY_CHANNEL_ID`
- `OP_LOOKBACK_DAYS`
- `OP_MAX_RECORDS`
- `OP_DRY_RUN`
- Shared source, identity, delivery renderer, and run-summary workflow IDs

## Safety

1. The source adapter owns stable IDs and processed-record claims.
2. The model returns JSON and cannot deliver or mutate systems.
3. Delivery requires dry-run off, notification eligibility, and a resolved target.
4. The starter uses a fictional fixture and cannot contact source or delivery systems by default.
