# Activity Gap Detector — Platform-Agnostic Recipe

## Reference Architecture

`trigger -> canonical source adapter -> Backstory enrichment -> structured analysis -> identity resolution -> delivery renderer -> native delivery -> run summary`

## Implementation Rules

1. Normalize connector-specific data into one canonical source record.
2. Use Backstory MCP only for enrichment and evidence analysis.
3. Require structured model output before deterministic routing.
4. Use stable source IDs, claims, and dedupe keys.
5. Keep dry-run enabled until representative source, routing, and delivery tests pass.

## Purpose

Compares each rep's weekly activity patterns against team benchmarks and top performer profiles using Backstory activity data. Identifies reps with low outbound activity, thin multi-threading on key deals, or single-threaded opportunities missing executive engagement. An AI agent generates personalized coaching nudges for sales managers, highlighting specific gaps and suggesting actionable improvement areas. Delivered weekly to frontline managers via Messaging.
