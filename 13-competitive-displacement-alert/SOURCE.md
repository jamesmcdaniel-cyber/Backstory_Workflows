# 13 — Competitive Displacement Alert

## Overview

Monitors customer accounts for early signs of competitive displacement. The workflow scans Backstory engagement data for accounts where internal engagement has suddenly dropped while simultaneously checking for competitor mentions in email subjects, meeting titles, or CRM notes. An AI agent evaluates the combined signals to assess displacement risk and recommends defensive actions. High-risk alerts are sent immediately to the account owner and their manager via Messaging.

The production template uses canonical source, identity, delivery-rendering, and run-summary contracts. The model is limited to structured evidence analysis; source access, claims, routing, delivery, and observability are deterministic.

## Contracts

- `run_context`: mode, dry-run, source, lookback, and delivery defaults
- `source_record`: one canonical record with a stable source ID
- `enrichment_context`: Backstory MCP evidence used only during analysis
- `delivery_payload`: deterministic target, body, thread key, and dedupe key

## Production Configuration

- `CDA_SOURCE_API_BASE_URL`
- `CDA_SOURCE_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `CDA_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID`
- `CDA_SUMMARY_CHANNEL_ID`
- `CDA_LOOKBACK_DAYS`
- `CDA_MAX_RECORDS`
- `CDA_DRY_RUN`
- Shared source, identity, delivery renderer, and run-summary workflow IDs

## Safety

1. The source adapter owns stable IDs and processed-record claims.
2. The model returns JSON and cannot deliver or mutate systems.
3. Delivery requires dry-run off, notification eligibility, and a resolved target.
4. The starter uses a fictional fixture and cannot contact source or delivery systems by default.
