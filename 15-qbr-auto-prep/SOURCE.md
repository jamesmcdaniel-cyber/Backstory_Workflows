# 15 — QBR Auto-Prep

## Overview

Automatically prepares quarterly business review materials for every account on an upcoming QBR agenda. The workflow scans the calendar for meetings tagged as QBRs (or matching configurable title patterns), then for each account on the agenda, pulls the full quarter's engagement data from Backstory: meeting frequency, email volume, contacts engaged, key relationship changes, and deal progression. An AI agent generates a structured QBR prep document with executive summary, engagement trends, wins/risks, and talking points. Delivered to the account team 48 hours before the QBR.

The production template uses canonical source, identity, delivery-rendering, and run-summary contracts. The model is limited to structured evidence analysis; source access, claims, routing, delivery, and observability are deterministic.

## Contracts

- `run_context`: mode, dry-run, source, lookback, and delivery defaults
- `source_record`: one canonical record with a stable source ID
- `enrichment_context`: Backstory MCP evidence used only during analysis
- `delivery_payload`: deterministic target, body, thread key, and dedupe key

## Production Configuration

- `QAP_SOURCE_API_BASE_URL`
- `QAP_SOURCE_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `QAP_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID`
- `QAP_SUMMARY_CHANNEL_ID`
- `QAP_LOOKBACK_DAYS`
- `QAP_MAX_RECORDS`
- `QAP_DRY_RUN`
- Shared source, identity, delivery renderer, and run-summary workflow IDs

## Safety

1. The source adapter owns stable IDs and processed-record claims.
2. The model returns JSON and cannot deliver or mutate systems.
3. Delivery requires dry-run off, notification eligibility, and a resolved target.
4. The starter uses a fictional fixture and cannot contact source or delivery systems by default.
