# QBR Auto-Prep — Platform-Agnostic Recipe

## Reference Architecture

`trigger -> canonical source adapter -> Backstory enrichment -> structured analysis -> identity resolution -> delivery renderer -> native delivery -> run summary`

## Implementation Rules

1. Normalize connector-specific data into one canonical source record.
2. Use Backstory MCP only for enrichment and evidence analysis.
3. Require structured model output before deterministic routing.
4. Use stable source IDs, claims, and dedupe keys.
5. Keep dry-run enabled until representative source, routing, and delivery tests pass.

## Purpose

Automatically prepares quarterly business review materials for every account on an upcoming QBR agenda. The workflow scans the calendar for meetings tagged as QBRs (or matching configurable title patterns), then for each account on the agenda, pulls the full quarter's engagement data from Backstory: meeting frequency, email volume, contacts engaged, key relationship changes, and deal progression. An AI agent generates a structured QBR prep document with executive summary, engagement trends, wins/risks, and talking points. Delivered to the account team 48 hours before the QBR.
