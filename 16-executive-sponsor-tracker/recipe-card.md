# Executive Sponsor Tracker — Platform-Agnostic Recipe

## Reference Architecture

`trigger -> canonical source adapter -> Backstory enrichment -> structured analysis -> identity resolution -> delivery renderer -> native delivery -> run summary`

## Implementation Rules

1. Normalize connector-specific data into one canonical source record.
2. Use Backstory MCP only for enrichment and evidence analysis.
3. Require structured model output before deterministic routing.
4. Use stable source IDs, claims, and dedupe keys.
5. Keep dry-run enabled until representative source, routing, and delivery tests pass.

## Purpose

Monitors executive-level contact engagement across strategic deals to ensure champion and sponsor relationships stay active. The workflow identifies open opportunities above a configurable deal value threshold, checks Backstory for executive contact engagement (VP+ titles), and flags deals where executive sponsors have gone silent (no meetings or emails in the configured lookback window). An AI agent assesses the risk of each silent-sponsor situation and recommends re-engagement tactics. Alerts are sent to the deal owner and sales leadership via Messaging.
